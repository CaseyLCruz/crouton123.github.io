**Introduction**
Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that affects how your body creates energy from food. The food you eat is broken down into sugar which is released into your bloodstream. When this happens, your blood sugar levels go up, but your pancreas releases insulin to stabilize it. With a person that has diabetes, their body cannot regulate blood sugar levels through the use of insulin as well as someone without diabetes. This results in too much blood sugar remaining in the bloodstream and this can cause serious health concerns.
  
In the US there are around 38 million adults that have diabetes. It is the 8th leading cause of death in the US and the number 1 cause of kidney failure, lower-limb amputation, and adult blindness. The number of adults that have been diagnosed with diabetes has doubled in the last twenty years which is a major problem. For this project, I have chosen to look at a dataset that includes data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) which collects data on health-related risk behaviors and chronic health conditions. The data specifically used came from a 2021 BRFSS dataset. This data can be used to understand the main conditions that relate to someone having diabetes. With that, information on the best preventative measures can be identified and released to the public to show them which things are most important to reduce their chances of getting diabetes.
